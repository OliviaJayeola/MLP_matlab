# MLP_matlab
University project

This was coursework for a neural networks module where I was introduced to the theory/maths behind neural network algorithms, I was given a multi-layer perceptron, some inputs and weights and asked to manually calculate the weight updates for two epochs then implement the MLP in matlab. This was quite a simple task for me but it definitely taught me that human error is real like everytime I’d check my manual calculations there’d be an error somewhere but I eventually got everything accurate. I actually enjoy just simply programming and building stuff outside of all the libraries etc

note: I was given different input and weight values to the ones in this pdf
